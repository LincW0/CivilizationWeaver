# CivilizationWeaver

## Description
 A game in development.

 Currently you can use it as a very inacurrate population simulator.

## Structure

 A structure is something that you can build on the map.

 P.S. The building function is not implemented.

### City

 A city is a structure.

 It's, well, a city / town / village / etc.

 It consists of city components.

 It's currently the only structure.

 (And the only structure that people can live in, theoretically.)

#### City Components

 Plot of land in city where you do specific things.

 Such as farms, houses, factories, etc.

 Note that none of the above is actually implemented.
